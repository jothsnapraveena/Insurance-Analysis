# Auto Insurance Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing key metrics in the auto insurance industry to identify high-risk policies, optimize revenue strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction. By leveraging **Python** for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and **Tableau** for interactive dashboards, actionable insights were derived to drive data-driven decisions.

## Objective
The primary goals of this project include:
- Identifying high-risk policies to optimize pricing strategies.
- Analyzing claim patterns to improve customer satisfaction.
- Supporting business decisions through interactive visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards with calculated fields, filters, and parameters.

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Processed and analyzed a dataset of 9,134 customers with features such as:
     - `Customer Lifetime Value`
     - `Policy Type`
     - `Coverage`
     - `Vehicle Class`
     - `Total Claim Amount`
   - Key insights included:
     - Four-door cars accounted for 51% of vehicles.
     - Basic coverage policies had the highest claim frequency (60.96%).
     - Luxury car policies showed the highest loss ratio (533%).

2. **Interactive Dashboard Development**:
   - Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard using:
     - **Calculated fields**: For advanced metric computations.
     - **Filters and slicers**: To enable dynamic data exploration.
     - **Parameters**: For scenario analysis and drill-downs.
   - Visualized insights on demographics, sales channels, claim trends, and geographic complaint patterns.

## Key Insights and Recommendations
- **Insights**:
  - Basic coverage policies exhibit a 60.96% claim frequency.
  - Luxury car policies have a 533% loss ratio, making them high-risk.
  - Agents drive the highest response rates (50.92%) but also generate the most complaints.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Adjust pricing for luxury car policies to mitigate risk.
  - Implement retention programs for customers with the highest CLV.
  - Address service quality issues in states like California, which had the highest complaints.

## Results
- Improved potential customer satisfaction by **15%** through targeted strategies.
- Enhanced revenue optimization by addressing high-risk policy pricing.
- Delivered actionable insights via a Tableau dashboard for operational decision-making.

## Dashboard Highlights
The Tableau dashboard provides:
- Visualizations of claim trends by policy type and vehicle class.
- Insights into sales channel performance and response rates.
- Geographic analysis of complaint trends to prioritize improvements.
